Set:
The sets are  unique type of data structure mostly used because it does not allow the repetition of the elements. The
basic operations of sets are shown below:
eg:
A hashset is created and elements are stored in the set using the add methods.

Set types:
Linked set, hashsed set, and tree set.
=>Hashset:
Hashset doesn't guarantee any order, it allows on null key, fastest for common operations like add, search and remove.

=>Linked Hashset:
They keep elements in the order they are added, allows one null key, its close second.

=>TreeSet:
Sorts all objects, doesnt allow null key, much slower, because it needs to perform sorting.

=>Queue:
It is a data structure that follows(First in First out) structure.
In the following example, we will create the LinkedBlockingQueue, which is of dynamic size. It's not required to
provide size while creating LinkedBlockingQueue.
