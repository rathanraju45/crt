Inheritance:
=>Inheritance is used to store information and manage the information in a hierarichal order.
=>It is the process of defining a new class based on an existing class where a child acquires the properties of the parent
class.
=>The subclass(Child/Derived class) inherits the properties of the parent class, and the class from which the properties
are inherited is called Super class.
=>Inheritance allows us to reuse code and improve the reusability in java applications so that the class has to write
only the unique feature and rest of the common properties and functionalities can be extended by the other class.

Terminology:
Super class : Super class is a class whose properties and behaviour are used by the child class.
Sub Class   : Sub class is a class that inherits the properties of another class.
Reusability : Inheritance allows the reuse of code. When we create a new class and there is already a class that include
              some common properties or feature that class has to write, it cn be driven to the new class from the
              existing class by reusing the field and methods.

Extend Keyword:
Extend keyword is used to inherit the properties of the class.

Super Keyword:
The super keyword in java is a reference a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.

example program:

class Parent{
    void display(){
        System.out.Println("This is the parent class.");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent{
    void display(){
        super.display(); //calling display of parent class
        System.out.println("This is child class.");
    }
}

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Child c1=new Child();
        c1.display();
    }
}
