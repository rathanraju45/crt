RDBMS & SQL:
1.What is RDBMS?
=> Rdbms stands for Relational Management System. In RDBMS data is represented in terms of tables where each table has
its own primary key.

Properties:
a.All of their values in a column have the same data type.
b.Each row is unique.
c.Each column has a unique name.

2.Types of Database languages?
=> Databases languages can be used to read, store and update the data
=> There are 4 types of database languages:
1.DDL
2.DCL
3.DML
4.TCL

1.DDL:
=> Data Definition Language. It is used to define database structure or patterns.
=> It is used to create schema, tables, indexes, constraints etc., in the database.
=> Using DDL statements, you can create the skeleton of the database. Data definition language is is used to store the
information of meta data like the tables and so on.
=> Here are the tasks that come under DDL:
    1. Create   : It is used to create objects in the database.
    2. Alter    : It is used to alter the structure of the database.
    3. Drop     : It is used to delete objects from the database.
    4. Truncate : It is used to remove all records from a table.
    5. Rename   : It is used to rename an object.
    6. Comment  : It is used to comment on the data dictionary.
2.DCL:
=> Data Control Language. It is used to receive the stored or saved data.
=> The DCL execution is transactional. It also has rollback parameters.
=> Here are some tasks that DCL can do:
    1. Grant  : It is used to give user access privileges to a database.
    2. Revoke : It is used to take back privileges from user.
3.DML:
=> Data Manipulation Language. It is used for accessing data in database. It handles user's requests.
=> Tasks that comes under DML:
    1. select       : It is used to retrieve data from a database.
    2. Insert       : It is used to update existing data within a table.
    3. Delete       : It is used to delete all records from a table.
    4. Update       : It is used to update existing data within a table.
    5. Merge        : It performs UPSERT Operations. i.e, Insert or update operations.
    6. Call         : It is used to call a structured query language or a java subprogram.
    7. Explain Plan : It has the parameter of explaining data.
    8. LockTable    : It controls concurrency.
4.TCL:
=> TCL is used to changes made by the DML statements. TCL can be grouped into transactions.
Tasks:
1. Commit   : It is used to save the transaction on the database.
2. RollBack : It is used to restore the database to original since the last commit.

ACID properties:
=> As we know the integrity is one of the properties of DBMS, so in order to maintain this property there are some
properties describes called ACID Properties:
    => A-ATOMICITY   : Either the operation performed or not, there is no in between.
    => C-CONSISTENCY : (means the value should remain preserved always, which means if a change in the database is
                       made, it should remain preserved always.
    => I-ISOLATION   : Where no data should affect the other one
    => D-DURABILITY  : This stands that the data after he successful execution of the operation becomes permanent in
                       the database.

3.What is sharding:
It is a type of Database partitioning in which large database is divided or partitioned into smaller data, also known
as shards. These shards are not only smaller, but also faster and hence easy to manage.

Keys in DBMS:
=> Keys ae the part of relational databases. It is used to uniquely identify any record or row of data from the table.
=> It is also used to establish relationships between tables.

Primary Key:
=> An entity can contain multiple keys. The key which is  most suitable from those lists become a primary key.

Candidate Key:
=> The remaining attributes except for primary key are considered as a candidate key. The candidate keys are as strong
as primary key.

Super Key:
=> It is a super set of a candidate Key.

Foreign Key:
=> Foreign keys are the columns of the table which is used to point to the primary key of another table.

Relationships in DBMS:
=> One-to-One Relationship:
    => Such relationship exists when each record of one table can be related to one record of other table.

=> One-to-Many Relationship:
    => Such relationship exists when each record of one table can be related to one or more than one record of the other
    table.

=> Many-to-Many Relationship:
    => Such a relationship exists when each record of the first table can be related to one or more than one record of
    the second table and a single record of the second table can be related to one or more than one rcord of the first
    table.)
    ex: Customer-Product
    =>Each customer can buy more than one product and a product can be bought by many customers.

Assignment:

Designing an Organization Database
Table1: Employees
.employee_id(Primary Key)
.first_name
.last_name
.date_of_birth
.email
.phone
.department_id(Foreign Key)

Table2: Department
.department_id(Primary Key)
.department_name

*insert at least 5 sample employee records in "Employee" table
*insert at least 3 sample department records into the "Department" table.

Solution:

Creating tables:
CREATE TABLE Department(department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,department_name VARCHAR(10))
CREATE TABLE Employees(employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,first_name VARCHAR(20),last_name VARCHAR(20),date_of_birth DATE,email VARCHAR(50),phone VARCHAR(15),department_id int,FOREIGN KEY(department_id) REFERENCES Department(department_id)

Insertion of data:
INSERT INTO Department(department_id,department_name) VALUES (101,'cse'),(102,'ece'),(103,'eee'),(104,'civil'),(105,'mech');
INSERT INTO Employees(employee_id,first_name,last_name,date_of_birth,email,phone,department_id) VALUES
