Hashmap in java:
java.util.package. It provides the basic implementation of Mapinterface of java. It store the dat in a key
key-value mapping, in which every key is mapped to exactly one value of any data type.

keys should be unique as the key is used to retrieve the corresponding value from the map.
they are denoted as HashMap<k,v>, where k stands for key and v stands for value.
syntax:
public class HashMap<k,v> extends AbstractMap<k,v> implements Map<k,v>

constructors in HashMap in java:
1. HashMap()
2.HashMap(int initialCapacity)
3.HashMap(int initialCapacity,float loadFactor)
4.HashMap(Map map)

Hashing: Hasmap in java works on the prnciple of hashin-an algorithm to map object data to some representative
integer values.

Hashing is the process of converting an object into intege form by using the hashCode(). hashCode()
method of object class return the memory reference of object in an integer form. So the Hash function
is applied to the key object to calculate the index of the bucket in order to stroke and retrieve any
key-value pair.
