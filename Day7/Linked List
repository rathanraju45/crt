Linked List:
A linked list is considered as a data structure similar to any other data structure like arrays, stack, and queues. Here
every node is interconnected to the next node through a memory address link.

A LinkedList has three elements:
=>Head
=>Nodes
=>Tail

=>This is one of the most useful data structure and highly used in real-world scenarios because of its high-speed
capacity and ast addition and deletion. This basic collection structure is the data in adn the address which points
to the next node functions as the guide of the respective node.
