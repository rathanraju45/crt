Practice Exercise1:
Based on the employee table below, select all fields from the employee table whose salary is less than or equal to
52,000/-(no sorting is required).

Solution:
CREATE TABLE employees
(employee_number int NOT NULL,first_name char(50) NOT NULL,last_name char(50) NOT NULL,salary int,dept_id int,
CONSTRAINT employee_pk PRIMARY KEY(employee_number));

INSERT INTO employees(employee_number,first_name,last_name,salary,dept_id) values
(1000,"john","smith",62000,500),
(1002,"jane","anderson",57550,500),
(1003,"Bard","Everest",71000,501),
(1004,"Jacl","Hovarth",42000,501),
(1005,"Rathan","Raju",80000,500)

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary<=52000

Task2:
create a suppliers table select the unique city values that that reside in the state of california & order the results
in descending order by city.

CREATE TABLE suppliers
(supplier_id int NOT NULL,supplier_name char(50),city char(25),state char(25),CONSTRAINT supplier_pk PRIMARY KEY(supplier_id));

INSERT INTO suppliers
(supplier_Id,supplier_name,city,state)
values
(101,"microsoft","vijayawada","Andhra pradesh"),
(102,"apple","vishakapatnam","Andhra pradesh"),
(103,"google","Hyderabad","Telangana"),
(104,"amazon","Cyberabad","Telanagana"),
(105,"Facebook","guntur","Andhra pradesh")

SELECT * FROM suppliers WHERE state="Andhra pradesh" ORDER BY city; or
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM suppliers WHERE state="Andhra pradesh" ORDER BY city DESC;

Task3:
Based on the customers table and the orders table, below, select the customer_id and last_name from the customers table
and select the order_date from the orders table where there is a matching customer_id value in both the customers and
orders tables. Order the results by customer_id in descending order.

Customer table:
customer_id,first_name,last_name,favourite_website,constraint(customer_id) Primary key

CREATE TABLE customers(customer_id int PRIMARY KEY,first_name char(50),last_name varchar(50),favourite_website varchar(25),
CONSTRAINT customer_pk PRIMARY KEY(customer_id))
Orders:
customer_id,order_date,constraint(order_id) primary key
CREATE TABLE order(order_id int,customer_id FOREIGN KEY,order_date date,CONSTRAINT order_pk PRIMARY KEY(order_id));

INSERT INTO customers(customer_id,first_name,last_name,favourite_website)
values
(101,"rathan","raju","amazon.com"),
(102,"yadala","balu","flipkart.com"),
(103,"subbu","star","google.com"),
(104,"neeraj","ganta","bing.com"),
(105,"anvesh","gupta","yahoo.com"),
(106,"nagendruuuuu","guptuuuuu","openai.com")

INSERT INTO orders(order_id,customer_id,order_date)
values
(1,101,12/06/2004),
(2,103,12/09/2008),
(3,106,25/10/1905)

SELECT customers.last_name,orders.order_id,orders.order_date
FROM customers
JOIN orders on customers.customer_id=orders.customer_id
